# Factorio-Inbuilt-Lighting
Adds free lighting to all power poles types as a QOL feature. Intended for map/zoomed out view and streaming/youtube pre night vision



Adds a free inbuilt light to all power pole types that uses no power and runs without a power connection. Is a pure QOL mod designed for streamers, youtube or anyone who wants to be able to see their base early game when zoomed out. Its intended for use before night vision goggles, and then when its setting is turned off (0) it removes all of the inbuilt lighting so night vision looks natural.

The mod scales the light for each power pole based on its powering range. There is a global setting to increase/decrease this as a percentage from 0 to massive based on your desires. 0 turns off the inbuilt light entirely and removes them from the map (save any UPS).
The maxiumum lighted radius is limited to 75 due to the Factorio game engine.

The mod doesn't change or replace power poles in any way and so if the mod is removed the game will just remove the inbuilt lights and not affect existing power poles.
The mod should be compatible with all other mods as it reacts when entities are placed in the game. No changes to any base or other mod entities occur. Hidden lamps are created for all sizes between 1 and 75 tiles at game start.
